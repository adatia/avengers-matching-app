# Avengers Matching Game
The Avengers Matching game is an iOS game where players test their memory using a randomized 4x4 grid with 8 pairs of images of your favorite Avengers! The goal of the game is to match all pairs of Avengers. The game features three modes: Singleplayer, Multiplayer and Time Trial.

# Scoring System
After a player finds a match, they receive one point. If they find another consecutive match, the amount of points they receive doubles! This chain multiplier resets when the player finds an incorrect match.

# Singleplayer
A classic game mode where players play the game by themselves and try to obtain the highest score possible!

# Multiplayer
A local multiplayer mode where 2 players compete to get a higher score!

# Time Trial
Follows the same rules as singleplayer with a twist: players now must find all matches within 60 seconds!

# Additional Features
* Leaderboards to maintain score
* Smooth animations when flipping images

# Usage
You can open avengers-matching-app.xcodeproj in Xcode and build the app to try it on Simulator!
